## 🖥️ MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with TensorFlow (Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a deep learning model that classifies handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 Features 

✅ Classifies handwritten digits (0-9) with 90%+ accuracy

✅ Implemented in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for easy experimentation

✅ Uses TensorFlow and Keras for training and testing

✅ Supports custom handwritten digit images for predictions
